## Installation Process

### Hardware Setup

#### Arduino Wio Terminal

Ensure you have the Wio Terminal, an Arduino compatible microcontroller, ready for use.

#### Sensor Integration

Connect the sensors to the Wio Terminal following the pin-out instructions:

- For the Ultrasonic Ranger sensor:

  - SIG connected to 18 (which is D3) on the Wio
  - GND can be connected to any GND port, VCC connected to either 2/4 (5V)

- For the Humidity & Temperature sensor:

  - SIG connected to 16 (which is D2) on the Wio
  - GND can be connected to any GND port, VCC connected to either 2/4 (both 5V)

- For the RGB LED bar:

  - SIG connected to 5 (which is l2c1_SCL) on the Wio grove port 1
  - GND can be connected GND port in Grove port 1, VCC connected to 3v3 on Grove port 1

- For the Speaker Actuator:

  - SIG connected to 13 (which is D0) on the Wio Grove port 2
  - GND can be connected to any GND port in Grove port 2, VCC connected to 3v3 on Grove port 2

- For the Flame Sensor:

  - SIG connected to D6 port on the Wio
  - GND can be connected to any GND port, VCC connected to any 3V3 or 5V port

### Software Setup

#### Arduino IDE

1. Open the Arduino IDE and navigate to Tools > Manage Libraries...
2. Install the required libraries by searching for the library name in the search bar in 'library' tab and clicking on the Install button.
   (Note: It is recommended to download the latest version of each library, for the full library list please see [here](https://git.chalmers.se/courses/dit113/2024/group-11/smartbin#components-you-need-in-order-to-use-smartbin))

#### Code Integration & Software

1. Download our project repository using Git command `git clone` and locate the `Terminal.ino` file containing the main code for the Arduino terminal;
2. Within the repository, you'll find directories `Terminal`, `Application` and `Resources` among others, which are the directories for properly initializing our system on Arduino Wio Terminal, the SmartBin+ desktop software and the resource files needed respectively;
3. Ensure to include the Secrets.h file with your WiFi credentials;
4. Upload the Terminal.ino file to your Wio Terminal using the Arduino IDE;
5. Open you IDE installed such as (IntelliJ Idea or VS code) and clean install Maven dependencies (through Maven clean+install commands: .\mvnw clean install)
